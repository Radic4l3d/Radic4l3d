Hi, I'm Roman! I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Systems Engineering at ESCOM IPN in Mexico City.
I'm passionate about technology, with a special focus on electronics and computer networks. I am fascinated by understanding how electronic systems work and bringing my ideas to life using tools like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

⚙️ Primary Language:
- C++ (Continuously refining my skills).

🧠 Currently Learning:

- Computer Networks and Bash for system administration.
- Practical applications with Raspberry Pi.

💡 Experience With:

- Circuit simulation using Proteus (especially with GALs and PICs).
- Digital hardware design using VHDL on Nexus boards.

🌱 Next Steps:

- Deepening my knowledge of Python and JavaScript.
- Mastering the Raspberry Pi for more complex projects.
